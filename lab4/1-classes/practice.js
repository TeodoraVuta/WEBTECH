// suppose we organize the artworks in a museum
// define a class Artwork that has the attributes author and year
// this class has the following methods - getArtworkDetails (prints out information about the artwork - author and year) and sellArtwork that receives a customer's namen and prints out a confiration message that the artwork was sold to them
// define a derived class Painting that has one extra attribute - medium (it can be oil, acrylic etc.)
// implement the getArtworkDetails to contain all attributes
// override the sellArtwork method to underline that for a painting only prints are sold, not original pieces
